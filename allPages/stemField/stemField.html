					  <p style="font-size: 20px; color:black; text-align:left; font-family:'aguafina-script'; line-height:1.7;">&emsp;&emsp;Starting at a young age, I have always taken an uninterest in... well just about everything. As I grew and matured, I jumped from intrest to intrest. One moment I am in love with baseball, to then suddenly quit. For the longest time, I was dead-set on being a lawyer. Law school is in my sisters near future, and considering I aspired to be the subpar person she is, that was the dream. The dream was to be flooded with uninteresting cases, stress, and did I mention a LOT  of reading??? Although I love reading, I would much rather do something, interesting.</p>
                  <p style="font-size: 20px; color:black; text-align:left; font-family: 'architects-daughter'; line-height:1.7">&emsp;&emsp; Nueces Canyon being the small, inopportune school it is, not much can happen. When living in a small town, with little to no educational oppurtunities, you become used to the cycle of settling for less. Until one day, less is not the only option. Due to one absolute genius IT guy, I discovered something far greater than settling for less. The STEM field suddenly became a huge intrest to me, as I try to soak up as much knowledge as possible. The "IT" guy, basically a computer science professor with an unreal amount of certifications, realized my interest and is guiding me through the field. In a short span of about 4 months, I have spent countless hours on many different aspects of STEM, from software and hardware. Although I am an extreme amature in anything computer science related, I am starting to be able to connect aspects of the field. As each week goes by, I am continiously eager to learn more about the vast field. </p>
				<p style="font-size: 20px; color:black; text-align:left; font-family: 'architects-daughter'; line-height:1.7;">&emsp;&emsp; As I know God has a plan for me, and everyone, I can slowly see a new page in my life being unfolded. Living in a tiny school, with extremely limited educational oppurtunities can leave many settling for less than sucess. Thanks to a genius IT guy, I was fortunate enough to find an opportunity in the hay stack. Learning parts of computer science has allowed me to escape the trap many fall into of settling. Although the field is extremely vast, and it seems as if there is an infinite amount of information, it has truly been fun to try and tackle some aspects of it. As I continue through this journey, I will be documenting most my projects, as well as development. As we part... I will leave you with something my ole' man once told me " How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. "
